# Welcome to the Solle Coding Challenge

This is a coding exercise to test your understanding of our frontend tech stack.

We use Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Vuetify

## Your Task

We would like you to display a list of our products.

We have set up a skeleton of a page, which you can find in "pages/products.vue"

We have also included a service which will retreive a list of our products from our API.

Your task is to use this service to load the list of our products, and display them however you wish.

Best of luck, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions: chandler@sollenaturals.com
